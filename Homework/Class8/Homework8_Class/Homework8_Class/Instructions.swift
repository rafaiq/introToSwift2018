//  Homework 8: Credit Card Management
//
//
//  Tasks
//
//  1) Hurricane Maria struck again and unfrotunately has hit this codebase hard. A bunch of code was erased and altered as a result and the codebase is not compiling. Please help in getting the codebase compiling without warnings or errors. In addition, the goal here is to get the user experience to match up with what is shown in the video. Pay attention to the details :)
//
//  2) Once you get the codebase humming again, make the textfield for security code more secure by adding modifying the 'Secure Text Entry' property.
//
//  3) Change the input accessory view of the 'State' field so that the user is forced to select from a pre-determined list of states using the UIPickerView.

//  4) Change the input accessory view of the 'Expiration Date' so that it shows a UIPickerView with two columns of options, one for month and one for year.
//
//  5) Modify the table view so that any active keyboard or input accessory view is dismissed when the user drags on the view
//
//  6) Add the ability to delete a credit card on the CreditCardsViewController simply by swiping the cell to the left
//
//  7) Modify the configuration of the CreditCardSummaryCell so that the nameLabel shows 'FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME' and so that the cardInfoLabel shows as "***[LAST_FOUR_CARD_NUMBER+DIGITS], expires EXPIRATION_DATE"
//
//  8) Add the ability to edit an existing credit card when a user taps on a credit card cell.
//
//  9) Research how to save your credit card data using NSUserDefault system, and then save your data so that if you kill the app and reload it, you can load your entered data.
//
//  10) Come up with 3 ways you can improve the codebase or user experience. List them for me below and the implement them.
//
